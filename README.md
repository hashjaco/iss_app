## ISS App

The ISS web application provides real-time updates of the location of the International Space Station, the time it will pass over your current location, and which astronauts are currently in space.<b />

There's also an interactive globe to drag around in-between updates  (:

### `Quick Start`

Run:
```
yarn install && yarn start

or

npm i && npm start
```
This application was bootstrapped with create-react-app, so it should automatically open up the browser over port 3000.



### `Notes`

The Scene moves the information container down, so some of the astronaut names are not visible. The scene component can easily be added back by uncommenting it, but for this project, being able to see the fetched data was higher priority.
