## ISS App

The ISS web application provides real-time updates of the location of the International Space Station, the time it will pass over your current location, and which astronauts are currently in space.<b />

There's also an interactive globe to drag around in-between updates  (:

### `Quick Start`

Run:
```
yarn install && yarn start

or

npm i && npm start
```
This application was bootstrapped with create-react-app, so it should automatically open up the browser over port 3000.
